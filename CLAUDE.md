# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

---

## 🎯 Role Division

**You (the user) make decisions:**
- What features to build
- What the product does
- Business priorities
- Any choices or direction

**Claude (the AI) does all computer work:**
- Planning documents (roadmaps, PRDs, sprint plans)
- Coding and implementation
- Documentation
- Technical sequencing (what to build in what order)
- File creation and organization

**Simple rule:** When there's a decision to make, Claude asks. Everything else, Claude just does.

## 📖 Essential Project Guides

**Before starting any work, familiarize yourself with these guides:**

| Guide | Purpose | Reference When |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md** | Tooling requirements, Docker setup, diagnostics | Setting up environment, troubleshooting infrastructure |
| **STYLE-GUIDE.md** | File naming, code style, formatting standards | Creating files, writing code, naming conventions |
| **TESTING-CHECKLIST.md** | Pre-commit checks, smoke tests, validation | Before commits, before deployment |
| **.gitignore** | What gets committed vs ignored | Understanding generated files policy |

**Key Standards:**
- **Tooling:** Node.js 18+, npm 9+, Docker Compose v2+, Azure CLI 2.60+ (see DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)
- **File Naming:** Varies by directory - UPPER-KEBAB for quick-reference/, kebab-case for templates (see STYLE-GUIDE.md)
- **Generated Files:** Commit `.docx` in fundraising/, ignore `.pdf` exports (see .gitignore comments)
- **Code Style:** Follow `C:\devop\coding_standards.md` - 2-space indentation for JS/YAML/JSON, camelCase for JS, snake_case for Python
- **Testing:** Run `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build` before commits (see TESTING-CHECKLIST.md)

**Quick Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Validate Docker Compose changes
docker compose config

# Check service health
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f [service]

# Pre-commit validation
npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Multi-Tenant Enabled:** {{MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED}}
**Tenant Model:** {{TENANT_MODEL}}

### Important Considerations

**When working on this project, always remember:**

- **Database schemas:** All tables (except system tables) must include `tenant_id` column
- **API endpoints:** All endpoints must be tenant-scoped (filter by tenant)
- **Authentication:** Tokens and sessions must include tenant context
- **File storage:** Files must be stored with tenant prefix (e.g., `s3://bucket/{tenant-id}/...`)
- **Testing:** Always test cross-tenant isolation

**See detailed documentation:** `technical/multi-tenant-architecture.md`

---

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: First-Time Project Detection

**Project ID:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**Created:** {{CREATION_DATE}}
**Status:** active

### First Time Opening This Project?

**IMPORTANT:** You are the project assistant for {{PROJECT_NAME}}, NOT the template system manager.

**If `_START-HERE.md` exists and user hasn't greeted yet:**

Proactively greet: "👋 Welcome to {{PROJECT_NAME}}! I see this is a new project. Would you like help getting started? I can walk you through creating your roadmap, sprint plan, and OKRs. Just say 'yes' or 'help me get started'!"

**When user responds positively, FIRST ask about setup mode:**

"Would you like:
A) **Quick Start** (5 minutes) - I'll create minimal roadmap + sprint 1 templates for you to fill in
B) **Detailed Setup** (15-20 minutes) - I'll ask questions and create comprehensive planning docs

Which would you prefer? (A/B or quick/detailed)"

---

## Quick Start Mode (Option A)

**Use when:** User wants to start fast, fill in details later

**Workflow:**
1. Ask for project brief (optional, can paste or skip)
2. Create basic roadmap with TODOs: `product/roadmap/initial-roadmap.md`
3. Create Sprint 1 plan with TODOs: `sprints/current/sprint-01-initial.md`
4. Update `.project-state.json`: `setupComplete: true`
5. Tell user: "Done! Your roadmap and sprint 1 are ready with TODOs. Fill them in and tell me when you're ready to start building, or say 'detailed setup' if you want the full planning workflow."

---

## Detailed Setup Mode (Option B)

**Use when:** User wants comprehensive planning upfront

**Workflow:**

### Build Approach Guide (for Claude to reference)

**When to recommend MVP-First:**
- User is uncertain about product-market fit
- Testing a new market or idea
- Complex product with many unknowns
- Want to validate with real users quickly
- Budget or time constraints require iterative approach
- **Most projects should use this approach**

**When to recommend Complete Build:**
- Small, well-defined project with clear scope
- Replicating existing product/workflow (migration project)
- Internal tool with known requirements
- All features are essential for launch (not optional)
- User has validated the concept already
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks total (not multi-month projects)
- **Example:** "Build a simple invoice generator with PDF export, email sending, and client management"

**When to recommend Growth-Stage:**
- Product is already live with users
- Shifting from ad-hoc to structured development
- Scaling team or infrastructure
- Adding governance and process

### Step 0: Check Project Brief Directory

**The `project-brief/` directory contains all project vision files.**

**On first interaction, Claude should:**

1. **Check for existing files:**
   ```bash
   # Use Glob tool to find all .md files
   ls project-brief/*.md
   ```

2. **Read ALL .md files found (except README.md):**
   - Read every `.md` file in `project-brief/` directory
   - This automatically includes `brief.md`, `vision.md`, `target-users.md`, etc.
   - User can add as many files as they want
   - Skip `README.md` (instructions, not content)

3. **If files exist:**
   - Use all content to inform planning
   - Reference specific details when creating documents
   - Don't ask user to repeat information already in the files

4. **If no files exist or files are empty:**
   - Ask: "Do you have an initial project brief or vision you'd like to share? You can paste it here and I'll save it to `project-brief/brief.md`."
   - **If user provides content:** Write to `project-brief/brief.md`
   - **If user says no/skip:** Proceed with discovery questions

**Throughout the session:**
- Reference project brief content when making decisions
- User can add more files anytime (vision.md, competitive-analysis.md, etc.)
- Claude will read new files when mentioned or when doing Task tool exploration

### Step 1: Discovery Questions (Ask ALL of these)

1. **Team Structure:**
   - "Are you a solo founder or working with a team?"
   - Solo → Focus on speed, minimal docs
   - Team → Add collaboration templates

2. **Build Approach:**
   - "Which approach fits your project?"
   - **A) MVP-First** - Build iteratively, validate quickly, ship small (most projects)
   - **B) Complete Build** - Build entire vision upfront, ship when done (small, well-defined projects)
   - **C) Growth-Stage** - Already have product, scaling up with more structure

3. **Product Concept:**
   - "What's your SaaS idea? What problem does it solve?" (1-2 sentences)
   - "Who are your target users?"
   - **If MVP-First:** "What's the ONE core feature you want to build first?"
   - **If Complete Build:** "What are ALL the features you need to launch?" (comprehensive list)
   - **If Growth-Stage:** "What's the current state and what needs improvement?"

### Step 2: Create Product Roadmap

After gathering answers:
1. Read `product/roadmap-template.md`
2. Create roadmap in `product/roadmap/YYYY-QX-roadmap.md`
3. Fill in based on their approach:

**If MVP-First:**
   - Product vision (their problem/solution)
   - Strategic themes (MVP focus, iterative releases)
   - Now/Next/Later breakdown (prioritize the ONE core feature)
   - Success metrics (validation-focused)
   - Timeline: Phased releases (Sprint 1 → v0.1 → v1.0)

**If Complete Build:**
   - Product vision (complete scope upfront)
   - Feature breakdown (ALL features organized by module)
   - Single comprehensive release plan
   - Success metrics (launch-focused)
   - Timeline: Build complete → Test → Launch
   - Note: "This is a complete build approach. All features will be built before launch."

**If Growth-Stage:**
   - Current state assessment
   - Strategic themes (scale, optimize, improve)
   - Prioritized improvements
   - Success metrics (growth and efficiency)

### Step 3: Create Sprint 1 Plan

1. Read `sprints/sprint-plan-template.md`
2. Create `sprints/current/sprint-01-[descriptive-name].md`
3. Break down based on approach:

**If MVP-First:**
   - High priority: Foundation + ONE core feature only
   - Medium priority: Supporting features for core
   - Low priority: Nice-to-haves
   - Estimate: ~2 weeks for solo, ~1 week for teams
   - Goal: Ship smallest viable version

**If Complete Build:**
   - Organize ALL features into logical build sequence
   - Create multiple sprint plans (sprint-01, sprint-02, sprint-03, etc.)
   - Each sprint = one complete module or feature set
   - High priority: Core infrastructure + essential features
   - Medium priority: Secondary features
   - Low priority: Polish and optimization
   - Estimate: Total timeline based on scope (typically 4-8 weeks for "small" complete builds)
   - Goal: Build entire product before launch

**If Growth-Stage:**
   - High priority: Critical improvements and scaling work
   - Medium priority: Technical debt and optimization
   - Low priority: New features
   - Estimate: Standard sprint cadence (1-2 weeks)

### Step 4: Set Initial OKRs

**If MVP-First (solo):** Skip or make very simple (1-2 objectives focused on validation)

**If MVP-First (team):**
   - Read `business/okr-template.md` and create quarterly OKRs
   - Focus on: Launch, users, validation metrics

**If Complete Build:**
   - Create comprehensive OKRs covering the full build timeline
   - Focus on: Completion milestones, quality metrics, launch readiness
   - Example objectives: "Ship all core features by Week 6", "Achieve 95% test coverage", "Complete beta testing with 10 users"

**If Growth-Stage:**
   - Full quarterly OKRs required
   - Focus on: Growth, efficiency, scale metrics

### Step 5: Register Project Details

**If user provided a trade name or description during planning:**
- Update projects database: `C:\devop\.config\verdaio-dashboard.db`
- Use Python script to update the project record
- Change "TBD" to actual trade name
- Add description

### Step 6: Next Steps

Tell user:
- "Your initial planning is complete!"
- "Review the roadmap and sprint plan I created"
- "When ready, say 'start sprint 1' to begin development"
- "Or ask me to create PRDs, tech specs, or other docs as needed"

---

## 💻 Coding Standards

**When writing or reviewing code, always follow our coding standards.**

**Reference:** `C:\devop\coding_standards.md`

### Quick Summary

Our standards are based on Google's Style Guides and prioritize:
- **Consistency** - Code should look like it was written by one person
- **Readability** - Code is read more than it's written
- **Maintainability** - Easy to understand months/years later

### Language-Specific Guidelines

| Language | Naming Convention | Line Length | Key Points |
|----------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Python** | `snake_case` (functions/vars), `PascalCase` (classes) | 80 chars | Use docstrings, type hints, specific exceptions |
| **JavaScript** | `camelCase` (functions/vars), `PascalCase` (classes) | 80-100 chars | Use `const`/`let`, JSDoc, arrow functions |
| **Java** | `camelCase` (methods), `PascalCase` (classes) | 100 chars | Use `@Override`, prefer interfaces |
| **HTML/CSS** | lowercase tags, `kebab-case` classes | - | Meaningful names, avoid IDs |

### Universal Rules

1. **Comments** - Explain WHY, not WHAT
2. **Functions** - Single responsibility, <50 lines, ≤3 parameters
3. **Error Handling** - Specific exceptions, meaningful messages, fail fast
4. **Testing** - Write tests for all features, follow AAA pattern
5. **Version Control** - Clear commit messages: `[type] description`

### When Implementing Code

**Always:**
- Read `C:\devop\coding_standards.md` before starting major development
- Use appropriate linters (pylint, eslint, checkstyle)
- Follow naming conventions for the language
- Write meaningful comments explaining complex logic
- Include tests with new code

**In Code Reviews:**
- Check naming convention adherence
- Verify proper documentation/comments
- Ensure code clarity and readability
- Confirm test coverage
- Be constructive, explain WHY when suggesting changes

**Full guide:** `C:\devop\coding_standards.md` (comprehensive examples and best practices)

## 🔌 MCP Integration (Optional)

**MCPs are optional helpers for development.** They let Claude access external services like GitHub, Stripe, and databases while helping you build.

**Important:** MCP tokens are for development only (helping YOU build), not for your production application.

### Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

**Recommended approach:** Shared tokens (all projects use same tokens)

1. Get a GitHub token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Open Claude Desktop config: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Copy contents from `.mcp-config-template.json` in this project
4. Replace `<your-github-token>` with actual token
5. Restart Claude Desktop
6. Test: Ask Claude "List my GitHub repositories"

**Recommended MCPs:**
- ⭐ **GitHub** - Manage repos, issues, PRs (start here)
- **Filesystem** - Claude can read/write project files
- **PostgreSQL** - Database queries
- **Stripe** - Payment data access

**Complete guide:** See `MCP-SETUP-GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions, security best practices, and advanced per-project token isolation.

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Document all significant work.**

### When to Document

**Required documentation:**
- ✅ **After every session** with multiple tasks (use Session Progress template)
- ✅ **After completing a sprint** (use Sprint Summary template)
- ✅ **After significant tasks** (>1 hour work, use Task Completion template)
- ✅ **After major refactoring** or architectural changes
- ✅ **After resolving complex bugs**
- ✅ **After integrating new tools or libraries**

**Documentation location:**
- Session/Sprint docs: `docs/progress/`
- Task docs: `docs/tasks/`
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/`

### How to Document

**Option 1: Use helper script (recommended)**
```bash
cd C:\devop\.template-system\scripts
python create_documentation.py --type session
python create_documentation.py --type sprint
python create_documentation.py --type task
```

**Option 2: Manual (use templates)**
- Templates: `.template-system/templates/documentation/`
- Copy template to project docs folder
- Fill out all sections
- Save with date: `SESSION-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**What to include:**
- Clear objectives/goals
- All files changed (created/updated/deleted)
- Results and validation
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Next steps and blockers

**Guidelines:** See `DOCUMENTATION-GUIDELINES.md` in template system for comprehensive best practices

---

## 🎯 When Helping Users

**Always:**
- Use Task tool (subagent_type=Explore) before assuming file locations
- Read templates before filling them out
- Ask clarifying questions about scope and goals
- Cross-link related documents
- Respect profile (solo vs team vs enterprise)

**Approach-based behavior:**
- **MVP-First:** Encourage speed, discourage over-planning, focus on validation
- **Complete Build:** Allow comprehensive planning, ensure all features documented upfront, emphasize quality and completeness
- **Growth-Stage:** Balance planning with execution, focus on scaling and optimization

**Never:**
- Create files without asking which template to use
- Generate generic platitudes
- Recommend over-engineering for MVPs
- Skip user research and validation

## 📊 Error Monitoring Guidance

**This project includes TWO monitoring solutions:**
1. **Sentry** → Best-in-class error tracking with session replay
2. **Azure Application Insights** → Azure-native monitoring and APM

**Your role:** Recommend the right option based on user's context.

### Trigger Phrases

Suggest enabling monitoring when user mentions:
- "deploy" or "deployment"
- "production" or "prod"
- "staging" or "stage"
- "beta users" or "launch"
- "going live"
- "ship to users"
- "publish" or "release"

### Recommendation Logic

**When triggered, assess the user's situation and recommend accordingly:**

#### Scenario 1: Solo Founder / MVP Stage

**Say:**
> "Before deploying to [production/staging], I recommend enabling **Sentry** for error tracking. It includes session replay which is invaluable for debugging user issues - you can literally see what they did before the error occurred."
>
> **Why Sentry for MVP:**
> - Session replay is HUGE for debugging (see exactly what users did)
> - Best-in-class error grouping
> - Free tier (5K events/month) is sufficient for MVP
> - Takes 5 minutes to set up
>
> **Setup:** See `_START-HERE.md#error-monitoring` (Option 1: Sentry)
>
> Would you like me to walk you through enabling it now?

#### Scenario 2: Team / Azure-Heavy Project

**Ask first:**
> "Before deploying, you should enable monitoring. I notice you're already using Azure infrastructure. Would you prefer:"
>
> **A) Sentry** - Best error tracking + session replay (external service)
> **B) Application Insights** - Azure-native monitoring + APM (stays in Azure)
> **C) Both** - Comprehensive coverage (recommended if budget allows)
>
> Which fits your needs better?

**If user says "Azure-first" or "keep everything in Azure":**
> "Perfect! I recommend **Application Insights** since you're already on Azure. It provides native integration, APM, and has a generous 5GB/month free tier."
>
> **Setup:** See `_START-HERE.md#error-monitoring` (Option 2: Application Insights)

#### Scenario 3: Production App with Revenue

**Say:**
> "For a production app with revenue, I recommend using **both Sentry AND Application Insights**:"
>
> **Sentry** → Frontend errors + session replay (for debugging user issues)
> **App Insights** → Backend performance + Azure metrics (for infrastructure monitoring)
>
> **Cost:** ~$26-76/month total (worth it for comprehensive monitoring)
>
> **Setup:** See `_START-HERE.md#error-monitoring` (Option 3: Both)
>
> This gives you the best of both worlds - session replay for user debugging AND Azure infrastructure insights.

#### Scenario 4: Still Developing Locally

**Say:**
> "Since you're still in [planning/development] phase, I recommend waiting to enable monitoring. Both Sentry and Application Insights are pre-configured in this project but disabled by default."
>
> **Enable later when:**
> - Deploying to staging/production
> - Launching to real users
> - Going live
>
> This saves your free tier quota for when you actually need it.

### When NOT to Suggest

**Do NOT suggest monitoring if:**
- Project still in planning/design phase (no code yet)
- User hasn't mentioned deployment/production
- User explicitly says "local development only" or "prototype"
- User is setting up dev environment for first time
- No deployment plans discussed yet

**Reasoning:** Both monitoring solutions are opt-in by default to avoid wasting free tier quota during development.

### Sprint Planning Integration

**When user completes sprint planning for a production release sprint:**

Add task to sprint based on their situation:
- **MVP/Solo:** "Enable Sentry error tracking before deployment (5 minutes)"
- **Azure-heavy:** "Enable Application Insights monitoring before deployment (10 minutes)"
- **Production app:** "Enable Sentry + App Insights monitoring before deployment (15 minutes)"

Reference: `DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md#error-monitoring-observability`

### Production Debugging

**If user reports production bug or asks about debugging production:**

1. **Ask:** "Do you have monitoring enabled? (Sentry or Application Insights)"

2. **If yes:**
   - **Sentry:** "Check Sentry dashboard for this error. Use session replay to see what the user did. Search by user ID, email, or timestamp."
   - **App Insights:** "Check Azure Portal → App Insights → Failures. Filter by time and operation name."

3. **If no:**
   > "I strongly recommend enabling monitoring to capture production errors automatically. This project has both **Sentry** (session replay) and **Azure Application Insights** (Azure-native) pre-configured."
   >
   > **Which would you prefer?**
   > - **Sentry** → Best for debugging user issues (session replay)
   > - **App Insights** → Best if you're Azure-first
   > - **Both** → Comprehensive coverage
   >
   > Would you like help setting one up? Takes 5-10 minutes.

### Cost Awareness

**Always mention costs when recommending:**

**Sentry:**
- Free tier: 5,000 events/month (~500 active users)
- Next tier: $26/month for 50,000 events
- Sampling: 10% production, 100% errors (already configured)

**Application Insights:**
- Free tier: 5GB data/month
- Pay-as-you-go: ~$2.30/GB
- Warning: Can scale to $100s/month at high volume

**Both:**
- Total: ~$26-76/month (worth it for production apps)

### Documentation References

**Quick reference:**
- **Setup guide:** `_START-HERE.md#error-monitoring`
- **Best practices:** `DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md#error-monitoring-observability`
- **Decision guide:** `technical/adr/examples/example-adr-monitoring-strategy.md`
- **Sentry ADR:** `technical/adr/examples/example-adr-use-sentry.md`

**Implementation files:**
- Sentry frontend: `web/src/lib/monitoring/sentry.ts`
- Sentry backend: `api/src/lib/monitoring/sentry.py`
- App Insights frontend: `web/src/lib/monitoring/app-insights.ts`
- App Insights backend: `api/src/lib/monitoring/app_insights.py`

### Multi-Tenant Considerations

**If multi-tenant ({{MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED}}==true):**

Remind user to set tenant context in errors:

**Sentry:**
```typescript
setUser({ id: userId, tenantId: tenantId })
captureError(error, { tags: { tenant: tenantId } })
```

**Application Insights:**
```typescript
setUser(userId, tenantId)  // accountId = tenantId
trackEvent('Error', { tenant: tenantId })
```

**Why:** Helps identify if issues affect all tenants or specific ones

## 📧 Task Notification System

**For long-running tasks (>15 minutes), notify user via email when complete.**

**Location:** `C:\devop\scripts\` (PowerShell scripts)
**Threshold:** 15 minutes
**Email:** chris.stephens@verdaio.com

**When to use:**
- Full codebase analysis or refactoring
- Large file operations (copying, moving, searching many files)
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Any task you estimate will take >15 minutes

**Usage pattern:**

**Before starting long task:**
```powershell
cd C:\devop\scripts
.\Start-MonitoredTask.ps1 -TaskName "ClaudeCodeWork" -ThresholdMinutes 15
```

**After completing task:**
```powershell
.\Complete-MonitoredTask.ps1 -TaskName "ClaudeCodeWork"
# Sends email if task took >15 minutes
```

**Tell user:**
```
"I'll start the notification system since this might take a while. You'll receive an email at chris.stephens@verdaio.com if it takes longer than 15 minutes."
```

**Documentation:** `C:\devop\TASK-NOTIFICATION-SYSTEM.md`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Safe Process Management

**NEVER use commands that kill ALL processes of a type.**

### ❌ DANGEROUS - Never Use These

```bash
# DON'T: Kills ALL Node.js processes (including other projects)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# DON'T: Kills ALL matching processes
pkill -f node
pkill -f analytics
```

### ✅ SAFE - Always Use These

```powershell
# Windows - Kill by specific port
netstat -ano | findstr :{{PROJECT_PORT_FRONTEND}}
taskkill /F /PID <specific-PID>

# Mac/Linux - Kill by specific port
kill $(lsof -ti:{{PROJECT_PORT_FRONTEND}})

# Docker - Stop only this project's containers
docker-compose down  # NOT: docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

**Golden Rule:** Always target processes by:
- ✅ Specific PID (from netstat/lsof)
- ✅ Specific port number (this project's ports only)
- ✅ Specific container name (`{{PROJECT_NAME}}-postgres`)

**Never target by:**
- ❌ Process name (`/IM node.exe`)
- ❌ Pattern matching (`pkill -f`)
- ❌ Wildcards that affect all instances

**See full guide:** `.config/SAFE-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT.md`

**Why this matters:** Other projects, terminals, and background processes are running. Killing all Node processes affects OTHER projects and can cause data loss.

**Start a new project:**
1. Greet user (if first time)
2. Ask: solo/team? MVP/growth/scale?
3. Recommend: Sprint plan + PRD + OKRs
4. Guide through templates

**Plan a feature:**
1. PRD first (PRD Assistant)
2. Then: Tech Spec → API Spec → Test Plan
3. Break into user stories
4. Link to sprint

**Document a decision:**
1. Use ADR template (System Architect)
2. State: Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences
3. Save in `technical/adr/`

**Research and compare:**
1. Search existing docs (Research Assistant)
2. WebSearch for external info
3. Document in `product/research/` or `technical/research/`
4. Provide recommendation with trade-offs

**For implementation:** Use Claude Code Templates (see `.config/claude-code-templates-guide.md`)

## 📦 Git Automation - Commit & Push Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** This project is connected to GitHub. After creating or updating documentation, automatically commit and push changes.

### When to Auto-Commit & Push

**Always commit and push after:**
- ✅ Creating planning documents (roadmaps, PRDs, sprint plans, OKRs)
- ✅ Updating existing documentation (any .md files)
- ✅ Creating technical specs (ADRs, API specs, architecture docs)
- ✅ Adding meeting notes or retrospectives
- ✅ Updating project state (.project-state.json)
- ✅ Any file changes the user requested

**Do NOT auto-commit for:**
- ❌ Code implementation (ask user first: "Ready to commit this code?")
- ❌ Configuration changes (.env, secrets, credentials)
- ❌ Dependency updates (package.json, requirements.txt)
- ❌ Database migrations or schema changes

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: add initial product roadmap"
git commit -m "docs: update sprint 1 plan with user stories"
git commit -m "docs: create API specification for auth endpoints"

# Planning
git commit -m "plan: add Q1 OKRs and success metrics"
git commit -m "plan: update project brief with user feedback"

# Updates
git commit -m "update: mark sprint 1 stories as completed"
git commit -m "update: add ADR for database selection"
```

### Standard Workflow

After creating/updating any documentation files:

```bash
# 1. Check status (optional, for awareness)
git status

# 2. Stage all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: <clear description of what was added/changed>"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin master

# 5. Confirm to user
echo "✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub"
```

### Example

```bash
# After creating roadmap
cd /c/devop/{{PROJECT_NAME}}
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add initial product roadmap and sprint 1 plan"
git push origin master
```

**Tell user:** "✅ Documentation saved and pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/ChrisStephens1971/{{PROJECT_NAME}}"

### Error Handling

If push fails:
1. Check if you're on the right branch: `git branch`
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin master`
3. Resolve conflicts if any
4. Push again: `git push origin master`
5. If still failing, inform user and ask for help
