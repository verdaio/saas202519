# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

---

## 🎯 Role Division

**You (the user) make decisions:**
- What features to build
- What the product does
- Business priorities
- Any choices or direction

**Claude (the AI) does all computer work:**
- Planning documents (roadmaps, PRDs, sprint plans)
- Coding and implementation
- Documentation
- Technical sequencing (what to build in what order)
- File creation and organization

**Simple rule:** When there's a decision to make, Claude asks. Everything else, Claude just does.

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Multi-Tenant Enabled:** true
**Tenant Model:** subdomain

### Important Considerations

**When working on this project, always remember:**

- **Database schemas:** All tables (except system tables) must include `tenant_id` column
- **API endpoints:** All endpoints must be tenant-scoped (filter by tenant)
- **Authentication:** Tokens and sessions must include tenant context
- **File storage:** Files must be stored with tenant prefix (e.g., `s3://bucket/{tenant-id}/...`)
- **Testing:** Always test cross-tenant isolation

**See detailed documentation:** `technical/multi-tenant-architecture.md`

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: First-Time Project Detection

**Project ID:** saas202519
**Created:** 2025-11-02
**Status:** active

### First Time Opening This Project?

**IMPORTANT:** You are the project assistant for saas202519, NOT the template system manager.

**If `_START-HERE.md` exists and user hasn't greeted yet:**

Proactively greet: "👋 Welcome to saas202519! I see this is a new project. Would you like help getting started? I can walk you through creating your roadmap, sprint plan, and OKRs. Just say 'yes' or 'help me get started'!"

**When user responds positively, FIRST ask about setup mode:**

"Would you like:
A) **Quick Start** (5 minutes) - I'll create minimal roadmap + sprint 1 templates for you to fill in
B) **Detailed Setup** (15-20 minutes) - I'll ask questions and create comprehensive planning docs

Which would you prefer? (A/B or quick/detailed)"

---

## Quick Start Mode (Option A)

**Use when:** User wants to start fast, fill in details later

**Workflow:**
1. Ask for project brief (optional, can paste or skip)
2. Create basic roadmap with TODOs: `product/roadmap/initial-roadmap.md`
3. Create Sprint 1 plan with TODOs: `sprints/current/sprint-01-initial.md`
4. Update `.project-state.json`: `setupComplete: true`
5. Tell user: "Done! Your roadmap and sprint 1 are ready with TODOs. Fill them in and tell me when you're ready to start building, or say 'detailed setup' if you want the full planning workflow."

---

## Detailed Setup Mode (Option B)

**Use when:** User wants comprehensive planning upfront

**Workflow:**

### Build Approach Guide (for Claude to reference)

**When to recommend MVP-First:**
- User is uncertain about product-market fit
- Testing a new market or idea
- Complex product with many unknowns
- Want to validate with real users quickly
- Budget or time constraints require iterative approach
- **Most projects should use this approach**

**When to recommend Complete Build:**
- Small, well-defined project with clear scope
- Replicating existing product/workflow (migration project)
- Internal tool with known requirements
- All features are essential for launch (not optional)
- User has validated the concept already
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks total (not multi-month projects)
- **Example:** "Build a simple invoice generator with PDF export, email sending, and client management"

**When to recommend Growth-Stage:**
- Product is already live with users
- Shifting from ad-hoc to structured development
- Scaling team or infrastructure
- Adding governance and process

### Step 0: Ask About Project Brief (Optional)

**Always ask first:**
"Do you have an initial project brief, vision statement, or prompt you'd like to share? You can paste it here and I'll save it to `project-brief.md` for reference throughout planning. (If not, just say 'no' or 'skip' and I'll ask you questions instead.)"

**If user provides content in chat:**
1. Write it to `project-brief.md`
2. Confirm: "Great! I've saved that to project-brief.md. I'll use this context for planning."
3. Use this information to inform all planning questions
4. Reference specific details when creating documents

**If user says no/skip or project-brief.md already has content:**
- Read `project-brief.md` if it has content (user may have added it manually)
- Otherwise, proceed with discovery questions normally

### Step 1: Discovery Questions (Ask ALL of these)

1. **Team Structure:**
   - "Are you a solo founder or working with a team?"
   - Solo → Focus on speed, minimal docs
   - Team → Add collaboration templates

2. **Build Approach:**
   - "Which approach fits your project?"
   - **A) MVP-First** - Build iteratively, validate quickly, ship small (most projects)
   - **B) Complete Build** - Build entire vision upfront, ship when done (small, well-defined projects)
   - **C) Growth-Stage** - Already have product, scaling up with more structure

3. **Product Concept:**
   - "What's your SaaS idea? What problem does it solve?" (1-2 sentences)
   - "Who are your target users?"
   - **If MVP-First:** "What's the ONE core feature you want to build first?"
   - **If Complete Build:** "What are ALL the features you need to launch?" (comprehensive list)
   - **If Growth-Stage:** "What's the current state and what needs improvement?"

### Step 2: Create Product Roadmap

After gathering answers:
1. Read `product/roadmap-template.md`
2. Create roadmap in `product/roadmap/YYYY-QX-roadmap.md`
3. Fill in based on their approach:

**If MVP-First:**
   - Product vision (their problem/solution)
   - Strategic themes (MVP focus, iterative releases)
   - Now/Next/Later breakdown (prioritize the ONE core feature)
   - Success metrics (validation-focused)
   - Timeline: Phased releases (Sprint 1 → v0.1 → v1.0)

**If Complete Build:**
   - Product vision (complete scope upfront)
   - Feature breakdown (ALL features organized by module)
   - Single comprehensive release plan
   - Success metrics (launch-focused)
   - Timeline: Build complete → Test → Launch
   - Note: "This is a complete build approach. All features will be built before launch."

**If Growth-Stage:**
   - Current state assessment
   - Strategic themes (scale, optimize, improve)
   - Prioritized improvements
   - Success metrics (growth and efficiency)

### Step 3: Create Sprint 1 Plan

1. Read `sprints/sprint-plan-template.md`
2. Create `sprints/current/sprint-01-[descriptive-name].md`
3. Break down based on approach:

**If MVP-First:**
   - High priority: Foundation + ONE core feature only
   - Medium priority: Supporting features for core
   - Low priority: Nice-to-haves
   - Estimate: ~2 weeks for solo, ~1 week for teams
   - Goal: Ship smallest viable version

**If Complete Build:**
   - Organize ALL features into logical build sequence
   - Create multiple sprint plans (sprint-01, sprint-02, sprint-03, etc.)
   - Each sprint = one complete module or feature set
   - High priority: Core infrastructure + essential features
   - Medium priority: Secondary features
   - Low priority: Polish and optimization
   - Estimate: Total timeline based on scope (typically 4-8 weeks for "small" complete builds)
   - Goal: Build entire product before launch

**If Growth-Stage:**
   - High priority: Critical improvements and scaling work
   - Medium priority: Technical debt and optimization
   - Low priority: New features
   - Estimate: Standard sprint cadence (1-2 weeks)

### Step 4: Set Initial OKRs

**If MVP-First (solo):** Skip or make very simple (1-2 objectives focused on validation)

**If MVP-First (team):**
   - Read `business/okr-template.md` and create quarterly OKRs
   - Focus on: Launch, users, validation metrics

**If Complete Build:**
   - Create comprehensive OKRs covering the full build timeline
   - Focus on: Completion milestones, quality metrics, launch readiness
   - Example objectives: "Ship all core features by Week 6", "Achieve 95% test coverage", "Complete beta testing with 10 users"

**If Growth-Stage:**
   - Full quarterly OKRs required
   - Focus on: Growth, efficiency, scale metrics

### Step 5: Register Project Details

**If user provided a trade name or description during planning:**
- Update projects database: `C:\devop\.config\verdaio-dashboard.db`
- Use Python script to update the project record
- Change "TBD" to actual trade name
- Add description

### Step 6: Next Steps

Tell user:
- "Your initial planning is complete!"
- "Review the roadmap and sprint plan I created"
- "When ready, say 'start sprint 1' to begin development"
- "Or ask me to create PRDs, tech specs, or other docs as needed"

## 💻 Coding Standards

**When writing or reviewing code, always follow our coding standards.**

**Reference:** `C:\devop\coding_standards.md`

### Quick Summary

Our standards are based on Google's Style Guides and prioritize:
- **Consistency** - Code should look like it was written by one person
- **Readability** - Code is read more than it's written
- **Maintainability** - Easy to understand months/years later

### Language-Specific Guidelines

| Language | Naming Convention | Line Length | Key Points |
|----------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Python** | `snake_case` (functions/vars), `PascalCase` (classes) | 80 chars | Use docstrings, type hints, specific exceptions |
| **JavaScript** | `camelCase` (functions/vars), `PascalCase` (classes) | 80-100 chars | Use `const`/`let`, JSDoc, arrow functions |
| **Java** | `camelCase` (methods), `PascalCase` (classes) | 100 chars | Use `@Override`, prefer interfaces |
| **HTML/CSS** | lowercase tags, `kebab-case` classes | - | Meaningful names, avoid IDs |

### Universal Rules

1. **Comments** - Explain WHY, not WHAT
2. **Functions** - Single responsibility, <50 lines, ≤3 parameters
3. **Error Handling** - Specific exceptions, meaningful messages, fail fast
4. **Testing** - Write tests for all features, follow AAA pattern
5. **Version Control** - Clear commit messages: `[type] description`

### When Implementing Code

**Always:**
- Read `C:\devop\coding_standards.md` before starting major development
- Use appropriate linters (pylint, eslint, checkstyle)
- Follow naming conventions for the language
- Write meaningful comments explaining complex logic
- Include tests with new code

**In Code Reviews:**

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Document all significant work.**

### When to Document

**Required documentation:**
- ✅ **After every session** with multiple tasks (use Session Progress template)
- ✅ **After completing a sprint** (use Sprint Summary template)
- ✅ **After significant tasks** (>1 hour work, use Task Completion template)
- ✅ **After major refactoring** or architectural changes
- ✅ **After resolving complex bugs**
- ✅ **After integrating new tools or libraries**

**Documentation location:**
- Session/Sprint docs: `docs/progress/`
- Task docs: `docs/tasks/`
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/`

### How to Document

**Option 1: Use helper script (recommended)**
```bash
cd C:\devop\.template-system\scripts
python create_documentation.py --type session
python create_documentation.py --type sprint
python create_documentation.py --type task
```

**Option 2: Manual (use templates)**
- Templates: `.template-system/templates/documentation/`
- Copy template to project docs folder
- Fill out all sections
- Save with date: `SESSION-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**What to include:**
- Clear objectives/goals
- All files changed (created/updated/deleted)
- Results and validation
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Next steps and blockers

**Guidelines:** See `DOCUMENTATION-GUIDELINES.md` in template system for comprehensive best practices

---

## 🎯 When Helping Users

**Always:**
- Use Task tool (subagent_type=Explore) before assuming file locations
- Read templates before filling them out
- Ask clarifying questions about scope and goals
- Cross-link related documents
- Respect profile (solo vs team vs enterprise)

**Approach-based behavior:**
- **MVP-First:** Encourage speed, discourage over-planning, focus on validation
- **Complete Build:** Allow comprehensive planning, ensure all features documented upfront, emphasize quality and completeness
- **Growth-Stage:** Balance planning with execution, focus on scaling and optimization

**Never:**
- Create files without asking which template to use
- Generate generic platitudes
- Recommend over-engineering for MVPs
- Skip user research and validation

---

## 📧 Task Notification System

**For long-running tasks (>15 minutes), notify user via email when complete.**

**Location:** `C:\devop\scripts\` (PowerShell scripts)
**Threshold:** 15 minutes
**Email:** chris.stephens@verdaio.com

**When to use:**
- Full codebase analysis or refactoring
- Large file operations (copying, moving, searching many files)
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Any task you estimate will take >15 minutes

**Usage pattern:**

**Before starting long task:**
```powershell
cd C:\devop\scripts
.\Start-MonitoredTask.ps1 -TaskName "ClaudeCodeWork" -ThresholdMinutes 15
```

**After completing task:**
```powershell
.\Complete-MonitoredTask.ps1 -TaskName "ClaudeCodeWork"
# Sends email if task took >15 minutes
```

**Tell user:**
```
"I'll start the notification system since this might take a while. You'll receive an email at chris.stephens@verdaio.com if it takes longer than 15 minutes."
```

**Documentation:** `C:\devop\TASK-NOTIFICATION-SYSTEM.md`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Safe Process Management

**NEVER use commands that kill ALL processes of a type.**

### ❌ DANGEROUS - Never Use These

```bash
# DON'T: Kills ALL Node.js processes (including other projects)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# DON'T: Kills ALL matching processes
pkill -f node
pkill -f analytics
```

### ✅ SAFE - Always Use These

```powershell
# Windows - Kill by specific port
netstat -ano | findstr :3019
taskkill /F /PID <specific-PID>

# Mac/Linux - Kill by specific port
kill $(lsof -ti:3019)

# Docker - Stop only this project's containers
docker-compose down  # NOT: docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

**Golden Rule:** Always target processes by:
- ✅ Specific PID (from netstat/lsof)
- ✅ Specific port number (this project's ports only)
- ✅ Specific container name (`saas202519-postgres`)

**Never target by:**
- ❌ Process name (`/IM node.exe`)
- ❌ Pattern matching (`pkill -f`)
- ❌ Wildcards that affect all instances

**See full guide:** `.config/SAFE-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT.md`

**Why this matters:** Other projects, terminals, and background processes are running. Killing all Node processes affects OTHER projects and can cause data loss.

# Planning
git commit -m "plan: add Q1 OKRs and success metrics"
git commit -m "plan: update project brief with user feedback"

# Updates
git commit -m "update: mark sprint 1 stories as completed"
git commit -m "update: add ADR for database selection"
```

### Standard Workflow

After creating/updating any documentation files:

```bash
# 1. Check status (optional, for awareness)
git status

# 2. Stage all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: <clear description of what was added/changed>"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin master

# 5. Confirm to user
echo "✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub"
```

### Example

```bash
# After creating roadmap
cd /c/devop/saas202519
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add initial product roadmap and sprint 1 plan"
git push origin master
```

**Tell user:** "✅ Documentation saved and pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/ChrisStephens1971/saas202519"

### Error Handling

If push fails:
1. Check if you're on the right branch: `git branch`
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin master`
