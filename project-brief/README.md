# Project Brief Directory

**This directory holds your project's vision, goals, and context.**

Claude will automatically read ALL `.md` files in this directory when starting planning, so you can organize your vision however you like.

---

## 📝 What Goes Here

**Core file:**
- `brief.md` - Main project description (what, why, who)

**Optional files (add as needed):**
- `vision.md` - Long-term vision and mission
- `target-users.md` - User personas and target audience
- `competitive-analysis.md` - Competitor research
- `market-research.md` - Market insights
- Any other `.md` files you create

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Paste Your Vision

Have an existing project brief? Just paste it into `brief.md` and Claude will use it during planning.

### Option 2: Start with Questions

Leave files empty and say "help me get started" - Claude will ask questions to understand your project.

### Option 3: Add Multiple Files

Create as many `.md` files as you want:
```
project-brief/
├── brief.md (main description)
├── vision.md (long-term goals)
├── target-users.md (who you're building for)
└── competitive-analysis.md (competitor research)
```

Claude will read ALL of them automatically!

## 💡 Tips

- **Claude reads everything** - All `.md` files (except this README.md) are automatically loaded
- **No specific format required** - Write naturally, Claude understands
- **Add files anytime** - Create new `.md` files as your understanding evolves
- **Keep it focused** - Each file should cover one aspect

## 🔒 Privacy

This directory is tracked in git and will be pushed to GitHub. Don't include:
- Sensitive business data
- Unreleased features (if repo is public)
- Confidential information

For private planning, use `.gitignore` to exclude specific files.
